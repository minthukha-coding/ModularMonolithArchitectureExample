# 🧱 Modular Monolith Architecture Example

This repository provides a practical implementation of a **Modular Monolith Architecture** using **.NET Core**. The project is structured to simulate a scalable, maintainable, and domain-driven enterprise application.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal is to demonstrate how to build a modular monolith where each module is independently developed, tested, and maintained, but all are deployed as a single application.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Modular Project Structure**
- **Separation of Concerns** via Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers

## 📦 Technologies Used

- .NET 8
- Swagger / Swashbuckle
